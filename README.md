# Machine learning pipeline for identifying past environmental exposures from post-exposure human serum samples


We developed a machine learning method that could use serum biomarkers to classify subjects by exposure groups and identify a biological signature of exposure to an environmental hazard. The biomarkers that distinguish exposed from non-exposed subjects may represent biological processes that have been impacted by the environmental exposure and could be useful in understanding and predicting immediate and future health impacts. 


The computational framework makes use of principal component analysis (PCA), multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a recursive feature elimination (RFE) approach. The detailed implementation of the proposed method can be found in the scripts attached. The scripts were written in Matlab 2016a environment.
